                        <div><h3>2 Years of Course Work</h3>
                            <p>I learned Object Oriented Programming and data structures on Java while at URI.
                            As such I have done many projects with varying degrees of difficulty using Java (check some out 
                            on the projects page!).</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Python</h2>
                        <div><h3> 1 Year of Course Work</h3>
                            <p>I learned to code using Python. Together with the IDLE environment I learned the basics of 
                            coding in my freshmen year of college. We made simple programs, adding in step by step different 
                            aspects of larger programs each week, from simple loops to file IO! Eventually we spent large 
                            amounts of time working on different programs that essentially painted a picture or worked on 
                            real world topics that programmers are struggling with today such as hash codes and bioinformatics.</p>
                            <p>Fast forward to senior year and Python was again used in my Algorithms class. Throughout the semester 
                            we would work with a different partner and work on solving a specific problem stemming from computer 
                            science theoretical problems. However, we would need to do so in a way that no only worked, but was 
                            efficient. We would also need to occasionally do analysis on the programs we created to see how well 
                            it actually running.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>SQL</h2>
                        <div><h3>6 Months of Course Work &amp; Internship</h3>
                            <p>I have worked with both MySQL and SQL Server.</p>
                            <p>I used MySQL in my most recent coursework at URI. Over the course of my last semester I worked on 
                            understanding many concepts with databases, such as Relational Databases. I have worked on designing 
                            databases and on structuring efficient queries. The semester concluded with a large project called 
                            StreamTV; a mock TV streaming service. Coupling HTML, TWIG and PHP I created a large site that I 
                            am very proud of. <a href="https://github.com/BlakeNappi/StreamTV">You can see it here</a></p>
                            <p>While at my internship with FM Global I created a large SQL Server query. I had to traverse a 
                            large database to restructure an existing query that was accessing one data stream and move it to 
                            an entirely different structure. Afterwards I made it accessible in our CRM, uploading it and creating 
                            a UI for both the query itself and the output. After peer review there was no discernable difference 
                            between the original query and the one I created.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>
                        <div><h3>5 Months of Course Work</h3>
                            <p>I spent a semester working on learning web design, both code and principles. Over the semester I 
                            learned about usability and accessibility. I learned how to create sites that could work on a 
                            varity of browsers and devices, while learning how to make them more convenient for those with 
                            disabilities. Through all of this I created this site and uploaded it to Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
                            <p>Also, with my StreamTV project I was able to work with TWIG. For those unfamiliar it is a template 
                            language for HTML. It was honestly amazing working with TWIG and it feels as if nearly all ecommerce 
                            web pages would use TWIG.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>C#</h2>
                            <div>
                                <p>I have the least experience with C# at the moment, however I am actively trying to learn more! I 
                                hope to create a some projects in the near future to bolster my knowledge. I have worked on a few small 
                                code tests for jobs in C# and I was exposed to C# while at FM Global. I created a page in Microsoft CRM 
                                Dynamics to act as a calculator using the pre and post-image of the page.</p>
                            </div>
                       
                        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                        <div><h3>5 Months of Coursework &amp; Internship</h3>
                            <p>I learned a lot of the basics of coding from my course in JavaScript early on in my career at URI. My 
                            first introduction to a lot of concepts and even a bit on how Object Oriented works came from JavaScript. 
                            I learned JavaScript alongside Python as well.</p>
                            <p>While at FM Global I did some JavaScript training. JavaScript was used frequently as the platform used 
                            at FMG was websites (for my department). There were some sections where I would check the JavaScript from 
                            upgrades to ensure it still worked, and to ensure it even transferred over. </p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>jQuery</h2>
                        <div><h3>2 Months of Coursework</h3>
                            <p>While I learned HTML &amp; CSS I had some time to learn jQuery as well. I used jQuery for a varity of 
                            small assignments and also again on this webpage. I'm still learning what can be done and hope to add more 
                            for you to see!</p> 
                            <p>The concept of jQuery fascinated me. Just code given to us as developers to use freely. Even though 
                            everything in jQuery could be done by hand just having it so readily available not only makes development 
                            just that much easier, but also gives way to an almost community feeling. A community where developers help 
                            each other, just giving out tools to help each other for seemingly goodwill. </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>PHP</h2>
                        <div><h3>1 Month of Extreme Coursework</h3>
                            <p>I only have a small amount of time that I worked with PHP. However, that amount of time I worked with PHP 
                            was very intense. In one month I had no experience of PHP and then I learned quickly how it can be used. 
                            The StreamTV project required PHP to be used as an intermediary language for the HTML and SQL.</p>

                            Eclipse was our first true IDE, making life easier for coding and also for helping our peers, as we all 
                            knew what each other was looking at. Eclipse helped pave the way to learning other IDEs as well.</p>

                            used the version control there as well, however it was all already setup and I had someone helping me every step 
                            of the way. I am now confident in using Visual Studio for Git thanks to my recent efforts at home!</p>
                            <p>While at FM Global I also used Visual Studio to work on some automation using the addon "Coded UI." We were

                            <p>I used Microsoft CRM Dynamics while at my internship at FM Global. My team worked tirelessly on two environments 
                            which ran on Microsoft's systems. I was able to see how the CRM functioned and how everything fit together. I worked 
                            on the upgrade for one of our systems from CRM 2011 to 2016, documenting changes and working on some small bugs 
                            that came with the upgrade as well.</p>
