                        I don’t have much experience for to offer you, I don’t have many projects for you to dissect, but I do have 22 years 
                        of life that has brought me here. I want to show you not only what I know, what is in my brain, but to show you what 
                        is in my heart and what has created it. When taking on someone new their skills is only a single piece of who they are, 
                        of what they will bring to the company. I want you to know exactly who I am the best I can show you, so while I walk 
                        you through a high-level overview of my life rest assured you will know me better for reading through this.

                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in Tiverton, Rhode Island, a small town on the border Massachusetts. I come from a Portuguese 
                        family. I’ve spent the majority of my life in Tiverton, going to all the public schools from 1st grade all the way 
                        through to graduation. I’ve always been more of an introvert and indoors kid. And with that came a more serious demeanor, 
                        trying to be responsible and not waste time.
                        <br /><br />
                        During high school I was on the school’s soccer team for four years. I was probably the athlete who had grown the most 
                        over the four years. When I began I could barely keep up with the team and eventually became a leader in my own right, with 
                        two years on the varsity squad.

                        I started at the University of Rhode Island in September of 2013. I originally went in undecided and after one semester I 
                        tried a few computer science courses and fell in love with the feeling of getting your code to work. That feeling of 
                        accomplishment was so strong that I wanted to continue it and I enrolled in the program.
                        <br /><br />
                        While at URI I took a job at the Center for Career and Experiential Education, where I did data entry under the supervision
                        of my URI 101 mentor, Tammy Leso. I worked there for two years, until my senior year. While there I learned and used excel 
                        to go through large amounts of data and crunch numbers for both employees in the office and for deans of colleges. While at 
                        the CCEE I worked on the beginning phases of the Rhody Alumni Mentoring Program as well. I researched various existing programs 
                        across colleges and then conducted surveys to gather URI student feedback and interest on the program itself.

                        I graduated in May of 2017. With my Computer Science degree, I am now looking for full-time work. While searching I 
                        have been trying my best to learn on my own. I am learning about different directions I can take my career, different 
                        languages and practices. I’m working to learn different tools and bringing everything together in larger comprehensive 
                        projects. During this I have learned about the industry and worked with URI specialists on both the application and 
                        interviewing process.
